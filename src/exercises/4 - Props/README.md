In this exercise you will gain experience passing props down from a
parent component to a child component. The Game component has an array of symbols that you will need to passed down and spread to the Square components. You will also need to pass a function down to the Square component from the Game component that prints "clicked" everytime you click on a Square.

The goal is two-fold.

1. Use the array data structure in Game and pass it down intelligently
   so that the squares render a symbol that is supplied to them
2. Pass down a function to each square that prints "clicked" everytime
   a square is clicked.

No need to use state yet.
