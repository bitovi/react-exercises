Exercises:

0. By running "yarn start" and selecting 2 for "Intro to JSX" it will build whatever you have in your components directory. This exercise is not really concerned with CSS, more it's about importing and exporting.

1. In the components directory above, there are 3 files. Square.js, Board.js, and Game.js.
   We are going to use React to make a simple Tic-Tac-Toe board. In Square.js, build a "dumb"
   component and export it.
   Import that component into Board.js, and use it. Export the newly created Board component.
   Import that into Game.js, and build a Game component which is the board, and 2 buttons.
   Take a look in the files above for more specific detail.

2. Instead of creating 9 <Square /> components inside of the Board component, is there a way to use a loop in Javascript to create them?
