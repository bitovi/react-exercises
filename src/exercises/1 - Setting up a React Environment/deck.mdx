# Setting up a React Environment

The best way to get up and running from nothing.

## Create React App

<Steps>

* The de-facto starter for the React community
* Create React apps with no build configuration
* _Includes_: Webpack with Babel, Linting, Testing
* `> npx create-react-app my-app`

</Steps>

---

## `npx create-react-app my-app`

<img src={require('./_deck/create-react-app.svg')} alt="npx create-react-app my-app" />

---

## Philosophy

<Steps>

* **One Dependency**: provides a cohesive curated experience
* **No Configuration Required**: so you can focus on writing code
* **No Lock-In**: you can “eject” to a custom setup at any time

</Steps>

## Ejecting

<Half>

This will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
