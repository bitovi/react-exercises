# Setting up a React Environment

The best way to get up and running from nothing.

## Create React App

<Steps>

* The de-facto starter for the React community
* Create React apps with no build configuration
* _Includes_: Webpack with Babel, Linting, Testing
* `> npx create-react-app my-app`

</Steps>

---

## `npx create-react-app my-app`

<img src={require('./_deck/create-react-app.svg')} alt="npx create-react-app my-app" />

## Philosophy

<Steps>

* **One Dependency**: provides a cohesive curated experience
* **No Configuration Required**: so you can focus on writing code
* **No Lock-In**: you can “eject” to a custom setup at any time

</Steps>

<Notes>

One Dependency: There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

</Notes>

## Ejecting

<Half>
This will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
</Half>

<Notes>
You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
