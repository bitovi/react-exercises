In this exercise you are going to use react-router-dom to
create an App that renders the About component when you
go to "/about", and the Home component when you go to
"/home".

The page should also contain two react-router-dom Links
to use to navigate between the pages.

How would you add a 404 page that matches any route that isn't either /home or /about?
